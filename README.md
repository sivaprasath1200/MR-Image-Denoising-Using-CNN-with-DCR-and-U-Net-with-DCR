# MR-Image-Denoising-Using-CNN-with-DCR-and-U-Net-with-DCR
The proposed method uses Deep learning for the reconstruction of the image. 
The model that is proposed produces high quality image with low processing time and 
automatically reduces the noise from the data. The proposed method uses skip connection 
which is proved more efficient than the deep neural networks. Two models are used for 
reconstruction of the MR Image – CNN with Densely Connected Residual Block and U-Net with Densely Connected Residual Block

OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:
• To use Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with Densely Connected Residual 
(DCR) blocks to build a model for reconstruction of a image.
• To use U-Net with Densely Connected Residual(DCR) blocks to build a model for 
reconstruction of a image.
• To produce high quality reconstructed images with less noise for subsequent image 
processing as well as clinical diagnosis.
